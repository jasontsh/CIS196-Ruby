# CIS196-Ruby
Ruby
HW01: Implemented insertionsort.  I looked up how to insert a value in an array.  It was not too difficult, but I learned more about arrays and the syntax of Ruby.
HW02: I have some trouble catching exceptions for fuelleft and speed.  I cannot catch the "numberformatexception" that exists in Java. Thus, I am simply running a if statement to check if the values are 0.  However, that also means that the user cannot input 0, which is logical here, but maybe not somewhere else.  
HW03: The paragraph is in another file.
