# CIS196-Ruby
Ruby
This is my first time to use GitHub in an academic setting, so it is very hard to get the first few commits.  However I got through so hopefully you can see the files!
HW01: Implemented insertionsort.  I looked up how to insert a value in an array.  It was not too difficult, but I learned more about arrays and the syntax of Ruby.
